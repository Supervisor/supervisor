3.0a1

  - Default config file comment documented 10 secs as default for
    'startsecs' value in process config, in reality it was 1 sec.
    Thanks to Christoph Zwerschke.

  - Make note of subprocess environment behavior in README.txt.
    Thanks to Christoph Zwerschke.

  - New "strip_ansi" config file option attempts to strip ANSI escape
    sequences from logs for smaller/more readable logs (submitted by
    Mike Naberezny).

  - The XML-RPC method supervisor.getVersion() has been renamed for 
    clarity to supervisor.getAPIVersion().  The old name is aliased 
    for compatibility but is deprecated and will be removed in a
    future version (Mike Naberezny).

  - Improved web interface styling (Mike Naberezny, Derek DeVries)

  - The XML-RPC method supervisor.startProcess() now checks that
    the file exists and is executable (Mike Naberezny).

  - Two environment variables, "SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_NAME" and
    "SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_GROUP" are set in the environment of child
    processes, representing the name of the process and group in
    supervisor's configuration.

  - Process state map change: a process may now move directly from the
    STARTING state to the STOPPING state (as a result of a stop
    request).

  - Behavior change: if 'autorestart' is true, even if a process exits
    with an "expected" exit code, it will still be restarted.  In the
    immediately prior release of supervisor, this was true anyway, and
    no one complained, so we're going to consider that the "officially
    correct" behavior from now on.

  - Supervisor now logs subprocess stdout and stderr independently.
    The old program config keys "logfile", "logfile_backups" and
    "logfile_maxbytes" are superseded by "stdout_logfile",
    "stdout_logfile_backups", and "stdout_logfile_maxbytes".  Added
    keys include "stderr_logfile", "stderr_logfile_backups", and
    "stderr_logfile_maxbytes".  An additional "redirect_stderr" key is
    used to cause program stderr output to be sent to its stdin
    channel.  The keys "log_stderr" and "log_stdout" have been
    removed.

  - '[program:x]' config file sections now represent "homgeneous
    process groups" instead of single processes.  A "numprocs" key in
    the section represents the number of processes that are in the
    group.  A "process_name" key in the section allows composition of
    the each process' name within the homogeneous group.

  - A new kind of config file section, '[group:x]' now exists,
    allowing users to group heterogeneous processes together into a
    process group that can be controlled as a unit from a client.

  - Supervisord now emits "events" at certain points in its normal
    operation.  These events include supervisor state change events,
    process state change events, and "process communication events".

  - A new kind of config file section '[eventlistener:x]' now exists.
    Each section represents an "event listener pool", which is a
    special kind of homogeneous process group.  Each process in the
    pool is meant to receive supervisor "events" via its stdin and
    perform some notification (e.g. send a mail, log, make an http
    request, etc.)

  - Supervisord can now capture data between special tokens in
    subprocess stdout/stderr output and emit a "process communications
    event" as a result.

  - Supervisor's XML-RPC interface may be extended arbitrarily by
    programmers.  Additional top-level namespace XML-RPC interfaces
    can be added using the '[rpcinterface:foo]' declaration in the
    configuration file.

  - New 'supervisor'-namespace XML-RPC methods have been added:
    getAPIVersion (returns the XML-RPC API version, the older
    "getVersion" is now deprecated), "startProcessGroup" (starts all
    processes in a supervisor process group), "stopProcessGroup"
    (stops all processes in a supervisor process group), and
    "sendProcessStdin" (sends data to a process' stdin file
    descriptor).

  - 'supervisor'-namespace XML-RPC methods which previously accepted
    ony a process name as "name" (startProcess, stopProcess,
    getProcessInfo, readProcessLog, tailProcessLog, and
    clearProcessLog) now accept a "name" which may contain both the
    process name and the process group name in the form
    'groupname:procname'.  For backwards compatibility purposes,
    "simple" names will also be accepted but will be expanded
    internally (e.g. if "foo" is sent as a name, it will be expanded
    to "foo:foo", representing the foo process within the foo process
    group).

2.2b1

  - Individual program configuration sections can now specify an
    environment.

  - Added a 'version' command to supervisorctl.  This returns the
    version of the supervisor2 package which the remote supervisord
    process is using.

2.1

  - When supervisord was invoked more than once, and its configuration
    was set up to use a UNIX domain socket as the HTTP server, the
    socket file would be erased in error.  The symptom of this was
    that a subsequent invocation of supervisorctl could not find the
    socket file, so the process could not be controlled (it and all of
    its subprocesses would need to be killed by hand).

  - Close subprocess file descriptors properly when a subprocess exits
    or otherwise dies.  This should result in fewer "too many open
    files to spawn foo" messages when supervisor is left up for long
    periods of time.

  - When a process was not killable with a "normal" signal at shutdown
    time, too many "INFO: waiting for x to die" messages would be sent
    to the log until we ended up killing the process with a SIGKILL.
    Now a maximum of one every three seconds is sent up until SIGKILL
    time.  Thanks to Ian Bicking.

  - Add an assertion: we never want to try to marshal None to XML-RPC
    callers.  Issue 223 in the collector from vgatto indicates that
    somehow a supervisor XML-RPC method is returning None (which
    should never happen), but I cannot identify how.  Maybe the
    assertion will give us more clues if it happens again.

  - Supervisor would crash when run under Python 2.5 because the
    xmlrpclib.Transport class in Python 2.5 changed in a
    backward-incompatible way.  Thanks to Eric Westra for the bug
    report and a fix.

  - Tests now pass under Python 2.5.

  - Better supervisorctl reporting on stop requests that have a FAILED
    status.

  - Removed duplicated code (readLog/readMainLog), thanks to Mike
    Naberezny.

  - Added tailProcessLog command to the XML-RPC API.  It provides a
    more efficient way to tail logs than readProcessLog().  Use
    readProcessLog() to read chunks and tailProcessLog() to tail.
    (thanks to Mike Naberezny).

2.1b2

  - Added new tailProcessLog() command to the XML-RPC API that
    is more efficient for just tailing than the existing
    readProcessLog() command (Mike Naberezny).

2.1b1

  - "supervisord -h" and "supervisorctl -h" did not work (traceback
    instead of showing help view (thanks to Damjan from Macedonia for
    the bug report).

  - Processes which started successfully after failing to start
    initially are no longer reported in BACKOFF state once they are
    started successfully (thanks to Damjan from Macdonia for the bug
    report).

  - Add new 'maintail' command to supervisorctl shell, which allows
    you to tail the 'main' supervisor log.  This uses a new
    readMainLog xmlrpc API.

  - Various process-state-transition related changes, all internal.
    README.txt updated with new state transition map.

  - startProcess and startAllProcesses xmlrpc APIs changed: instead of
    accepting a timeout integer, these accept a wait boolean (timeout
    is implied by process' "startsecs" configuration).  If wait is
    False, do not wait for startsecs.

  Known issues:

    Code does not match state transition map.  Processes which are
    configured as autorestarting which start "successfully" but
    subsequently die after 'startsecs' go through the transitions
    RUNNING -> BACKOFF -> STARTING instead of the correct transitions
    RUNNING -> EXITED -> STARTING.  This has no real negative effect,
    but should be fixed for correctness.

2.0

  - pidfile written in daemon mode had incorrect pid.

  - supervisorctl: tail (non -f) did not pass through proper error
    messages when supplied by the server.

  - Log signal name used to kill processes at debug level.

  - supervisorctl "tail -f" didn't work with supervisorctl sections
    configured with an absolute unix:// URL

  - New "environment" config file option allows you to add environment
    variable values to supervisord environment from config file.

2.0b1

  - fundamental rewrite based on 1.0.6, use distutils (only) for
    installation, use ConfigParser rather than ZConfig, use HTTP for
    wire protocol, web interface, less lies in supervisorctl.
