Medusa was once distributed under a 'free for non-commercial use'
license, but in May of 2000 Sam Rushing changed the license to be
identical to the standard Python license at the time.  The standard
Python license has always applied to the core components of Medusa,
this change just frees up the rest of the system, including the http
server, ftp server, utilities, etc.  Medusa is therefore under the
following license:

==============================
Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and
its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,
provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and

used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the
software without specific, written prior permission.

SAM RUSHING DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE,

NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
==============================

Sam would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the folks who
supported Medusa over the years by purchasing commercial licenses.
