# Caching DNS Resolver
# ===========================================================================
# The resolver is used to resolve incoming IP address (for logging),
# and also to resolve hostnames for HTTP Proxy requests.  I recommend
# using a nameserver running on the local machine, but you can also
# use a remote nameserver.

# ===========================================================================
# Logging.
# ===========================================================================

# There are several types of logging objects. Multiple loggers may be combined,
# See 'logger.py' for more details.

# This will log to stdout:
lg = logger.file_logger (sys.stdout)

# This will log to syslog:
#lg = logger.syslog_logger ('/dev/log')

# This will wrap the logger so that it will
#  1) keep track of the last 500 entries
#  2) display an entry in the status report with a hyperlink
#     to view these log entries.
#
#  If you decide to comment this out, be sure to remove the
#  logger object from the list of status objects below.
#

# ===========================================================================
# Filesystem Object.
# ===========================================================================
# An abstraction for the file system.  Filesystem objects can be
# combined and implemented in interesting ways.  The default type
# simply remaps a directory to root.

fs = filesys.os_filesystem (PUBLISHING_ROOT)

# ===========================================================================
# Default HTTP handler
# ===========================================================================

# The 'default' handler for the HTTP server is one that delivers
# files normally - this is the expected behavior of a web server.
# Note that you needn't use it:  Your web server might not want to
# deliver files!

# This default handler uses the filesystem object we just constructed.

# 'write-capable' commands are unavailable]

# ===========================================================================
# Monitor Server:
# ===========================================================================

# This creates a secure monitor server, binding to the loopback
# address on port 9999, with password 'fnord'.  The monitor server
# can be used to examine and control the server while it is running.
# If you wish to access the server from another machine, you will
# need to use '' or some other IP instead of '127.0.0.1'.
ms = monitor.secure_monitor_server ('fnord', '127.0.0.1', MONITOR_PORT)

# ===========================================================================
# Chat Server
# ===========================================================================

# The chat server is a simple IRC-like server: It is meant as a
# demonstration of how to write new servers and plug them into medusa.
# It's a very simple server (it took about 2 hours to write), but it
# could be easily extended. For example, it could be integrated with
# the web server, perhaps providing navigational tools to browse
# through a series of discussion groups, listing the number of current
# users, authentication, etc...

cs = chat_server.chat_server (IP_ADDRESS, CHAT_PORT)

# ===========================================================================
# Status Handler
# ===========================================================================

# These are objects that can report their status via the HTTP server.
# You may comment out any of these, or add more of your own.  The only
# requirement for a 'status-reporting' object is that it have a method
# 'status' that will return a producer, which will generate an HTML
# description of the status of the object.

        ms,
        cs,

        ]

# ... and install it on the web server.
