"""socket interface to unix syslog.
On Unix, there are usually two ways of getting to syslog: via a
local unix-domain socket, or via the TCP service.

Usually "/dev/log" is the unix domain socket.  This may be different
for other systems.

>>> my_client = syslog_client ('/dev/log')

Otherwise, just use the UDP version, port 514.

>>> my_client = syslog_client (('my_log_host', 514))

On win32, you will have to use the UDP version.  Note that
you can use this to log to other hosts (and indeed, multiple
hosts).

This module is not a drop-in replacement for the python
<syslog> extension module - the interface is different.

Usage:

>>> c = syslog_client()
>>> c = syslog_client ('/strange/non_standard_log_location')
>>> c = syslog_client (('other_host.com', 514))
>>> c.log ('testing', facility='local0', priority='debug')
