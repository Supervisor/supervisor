# This is an alternative event loop that supports 'schedulable events'.
# You can specify an event callback to take place after <n> seconds.

# Important usage note: The granularity of the time-check is limited
# by the <timeout> argument to 'go()'; if there is little or no
# activity and you specify a 30-second timeout interval, then the
# schedule of events may only be checked at those 30-second intervals.
# In other words, if you need 1-second resolution, you will have to
# poll at 1-second intervals.  This facility is more useful for longer
# timeouts ("if the channel doesn't close in 5 minutes, then forcibly
# close it" would be a typical usage).
