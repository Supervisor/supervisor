<h1> What is Medusa? </h1>
<hr>

<p>
Medusa is an architecture for very-high-performance TCP/IP servers
(like HTTP, FTP, and NNTP).  Medusa is different from most other
servers because it runs as a single process, multiplexing I/O with its
various client and server connections within a single process/thread.

<p>
It is capable of smoother and higher performance than most other
servers, while placing a dramatically reduced load on the server
machine.  The single-process, single-thread model simplifies design
and enables some new persistence capabilities that are otherwise
difficult or impossible to implement.

<p>
Medusa is supported on any platform that can run Python and includes a
functional implementation of the &lt;socket&gt; and &lt;select&gt;
modules.  This includes the majority of Unix implementations.

<p>
During development, it is constantly tested on Linux and Win32
[Win95/WinNT], but the core asynchronous capability has been shown to
work on several other platforms, including the Macintosh.  It might
even work on VMS.


<h2>The Power of Python</h2>

<p>
A distinguishing feature of Medusa is that it is written entirely in
Python.  Python (<a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>) is a
'very-high-level' object-oriented language developed by Guido van
Rossum (currently at CNRI).  It is easy to learn, and includes many
modern programming features such as storage management, dynamic
typing, and an extremely flexible object system.  It also provides
convenient interfaces to C and C++.

<p>
The rapid prototyping and delivery capabilities are hard to exaggerate;
for example
<ul>

  <li>It took me longer to read the documentation for persistent HTTP
  connections (the 'Keep-Alive' connection token) than to add the
  feature to Medusa.

  <li>A simple IRC-like chat server system was written in about 90 minutes.

</ul>

<p> I've heard similar stories from alpha test sites, and other users of
the core async library.

<h2>Server Notes</h2>

<p>HTTP server uses an abstracted 'filesystem object' to
gain access to a given directory tree.  One possible server extension
technique would be to build behavior into this filesystem object,
rather than directly into the server: Then the extension could be
shared between multiple types of servers.

<h3>HTTP</h3>

<p>The core HTTP server itself is quite simple - all functionality is
provided through 'extensions'.  Extensions can be plugged in
dynamically. [i.e., you could log in to the server via the monitor
service and add or remove an extension on the fly].  The basic
file-delivery service is provided by a 'default' extension, which
matches all URI's.  You can build more complex behavior by replacing
or extending this class.


<p>The default extension includes support for the 'Connection: Keep-Alive'
token, and will re-use a client channel when requested by the client.

<h2>Performance Notes</h2>

<h3>The <code>select()</code> function</h3>

<p>At  the  heart of  Medusa  is  a single <code>select()</code> loop.
This loop   handles all  open  socket connections,  both   servers and
clients.  It  is  in effect  constantly  asking the  system: 'which of
these sockets has activity?'.   Performance  of this system  call  can
vary widely between operating systems.

<p>There  are also often builtin limitations  to the number of sockets
('file descriptors')  that a single  process,  or a whole system,  can
manipulate at the same time.  Early versions of Linux placed draconian
limits (256) that  have since been raised.  Windows  95 has a limit of
64, while OSF/1 seems to allow up to 4096.

<p>These limits don't affect only Medusa, you will find them described
in the documentation for other web and ftp servers, too.

<p>The documentation for the Apache web server has some excellent
notes on tweaking performance for various Unix implementations.  See
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf.html">
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf.html</a>
for more information.

<h3>Buffer sizes</h3>

<p>
The default buffer sizes  used by Medusa  are  set with a  bias toward
Internet-based servers: They are  relatively small, so that the buffer
overhead for each connection is  low.   The assumption is that  Medusa
will be talking to a large number of low-bandwidth connections, rather
than a smaller number of high bandwidth.

<p>This choice  trades run-time memory use for   efficiency - the down
side of this is that high-speed local connections  (i.e., over a local
ethernet) will transfer data at a slower rate than necessary.

<p>This parameter can easily be tweaked by  the site designer, and can
in fact  be adjusted on  a per-server  or  even per-client basis.  For
example, you could  have the  FTP server  use larger  buffer sizes for
connections from certain domains.

<p>If there's enough interest, I have some rough ideas for how to make
these  buffer sizes automatically adjust  to an optimal setting.  Send
email if you'd like to see this feature.

some of the ideas behind Medusa's design, and for a description of
current and upcoming features.
