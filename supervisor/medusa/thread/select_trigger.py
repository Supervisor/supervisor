        """Wake up a call to select() running in the main thread"""

        # This is useful in a context where you are using Medusa's I/O
        # subsystem to deliver data, but the data is generated by another
        # thread.  Normally, if Medusa is in the middle of a call to
        # select(), new output data generated by another thread will have
        # to sit until the call to select() either times out or returns.
        # If the trigger is 'pulled' by another thread, it should immediately
        # generate a READ event on the trigger object, which will force the
        # select() invocation to return.

        # A common use for this facility: letting Medusa manage I/O for a
        # large number of connections; but routing each request through a
        # thread chosen from a fixed-size thread pool.  When a thread is
        # acquired, a transaction is performed, but output data is
        # accumulated into buffers that will be emptied more efficiently
        # by Medusa. [picture a server that can process database queries
        # rapidly, but doesn't want to tie up threads waiting to send data
        # to low-bandwidth connections]

        # The other major feature provided by this class is the ability to
        # move work back into the main thread: if you call pull_trigger()
        # with a thunk argument, when select() wakes up and receives the
        # event it will call your thunk from within that thread.  The main
        # purpose of this is to remove the need to wrap thread locks around
        # Medusa's data structures, which normally do not need them.  [To see
        # why this is true, imagine this scenario: A thread tries to push some
        # new data onto a channel's outgoing data queue at the same time that
        # the main thread is trying to remove some]
