Things to do
============

Bring remaining code up to current standards
Translate docs to RST
Write README, INSTALL, docs
What should __init__ import?  Anything?  Every single class?
Use syslog module in m_syslog for the constants?
Add abo's support for blocking producers
Get all the producers into the producers module and write tests for them

Test suites for protocols: how could that be implemented?
