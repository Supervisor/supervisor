Supervisor
==========

Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to
control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Supervisor has been tested and is known to run on Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS X
(10.4, 10.5, 10.6), and Solaris (10 for Intel) and FreeBSD 6.1.  It will
likely work fine on most UNIX systems.

Supervisor will not run at all under any version of Windows.

Supervisor is known to work with Python 2.4 or later but will not work
under any version of Python 3.
