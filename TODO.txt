- Collector issue 75:

  If the pid file isn't writable, it dies silently. When I ran it with
  --nodaemon this became clear, but nothing about the error goes into
  the log file or console when daemonizing.

- Collector issue 76:

  Adding -c to the shell script also drove me nuts for a while, since
  I got an error about two -c's. Maybe instead it could set an
  environmental variable in the shell script and read that for the
  default?

- Collector issues 78:

  The logs fill up with "INFO waitpid error!" (on FreeBSD) when you
  don't have any processes started. This happens when you don't have
  auto-start on, or just when the last process has temporarily died.

- Collector issue 84:

  I'd like to make Paste detect when it is running under Supervisor,
  mostly so it would know that it could safely die to be
  restarted. Otherwise it starts its own monitoring process to handle
  restarts.  I think always setting an environmental variable (e.g.,
  "SUPERVISOR_ENABLED") would be sufficient.

 - Collector issue 152:

   I'd like supervisor to look after a number of postgres instances
   (well, initially only 1, but I will need it to manage 3). The first
   difficulty I had was that the postgres start-up program (pg_ctl)
   takes an options param that it passes directly to the postmaster
   program it controls, which can contain several options that only
   the postmaster understands and it expects these to be in quotes so
   they are treated as a group, e.g pg_ctl -o "-p 4321 -h hostname -d
   datadir" but supervisor doesn't appear to preserve the quotes. In
   my case I only need the one option so I used -o "-p4321", as a
   workaround.
