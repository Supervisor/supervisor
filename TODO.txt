- Web interface:

   - present status in addition to state (e.g. spawnerr, etc, same as
     supervisorctl)

   - provide "restart all" functionality

- Make logging of stdout optional on a per-process basis (but default yes).

- Rewrite the delay/backoff stuff so humans can understand it.

- Make 'startretrysecs' and 'stopwaitsecs' "real".

- If a process dies with an expected exit code but keeps dying, it
  will restart forever.

- Unit tests for meld classes and ui server.

- Tail main log.

- Test log rotation.

- Command-line arg tests.

- supervisorctl one-shot tests.

- supervisorctl command history

- stop logging all RPC requests in info mode when we ship

- Test on Linux.

- Retest under 2.3.
