Introduction
============

Overview
--------

Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to control
a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.  It was inspired
by the following:

Convenience

  It is often inconvenient to need to write ``rc.d`` scripts for every
  single process instance.  ``rc.d`` scripts are a great
  lowest-common-denominator form of process
  initialization/autostart/management, but they can be painful to
  write and maintain.  Additionally, ``rc.d`` scripts cannot
  automatically restart a crashed process and many programs do not
  restart themselves properly on a crash.  Supervisord starts
  processes as its subprocesses, and can be configured to
  automatically restart them on a crash.  It can also automatically be
  configured to start processes on its own invocation.

Accuracy

  It's often difficult to get accurate up/down status on processes on
  UNIX.  Pidfiles often lie.  Supervisord starts processes as
  subprocesses, so it always knows the true up/down status of its
  children and can be queried conveniently for this data.

Delegation

  Users who need to control process state often need only to do that.
  They don't want or need full-blown shell access to the machine on
  which the processes are running.  Processes which listen on "low"
  TCP ports often need to be started and restarted as the root user (a
  UNIX misfeature).  It's usually the case that it's perfectly fine to
  allow "normal" people to stop or restart such a process, but
  providing them with shell access is often impractical, and providing
  them with root access or sudo access is often impossible.  It's also
  (rightly) difficult to explain to them why this problem exists.  If
  supervisord is started as root, it is possible to allow "normal"
  users to control such processes without needing to explain the
  intricacies of the problem to them.  Supervisorctl allows a very
  limited form of access to the machine, essentially allowing users to
  see process status and control supervisord-controlled subprocesses
  by emitting "stop", "start", and "restart" commands from a simple
  shell or web UI.

Process Groups

  Processes often need to be started and stopped in groups, sometimes
  even in a "priority order".  It's often difficult to explain to
  people how to do this.  Supervisor allows you to assign priorities
  to processes, and allows user to emit commands via the supervisorctl
  client like "start all", and "restart all", which starts them in the
  preassigned priority order.  Additionally, processes can be grouped
  into "process groups" and a set of logically related processes can
  be stopped and started as a unit.

Features
--------

Simple

  Supervisor is configured through a simple INI-style config file
  that’s easy to learn. It provides many per-process options that make
  your life easier like restarting failed processes and automatic log
  rotation.

Centralized

  Supervisor provides you with one place to start, stop, and monitor
  your processes. Processes can be controlled individually or in
  groups. You can configure Supervisor to provide a local or remote
  command line and web interface.

Efficient

  Supervisor starts its subprocesses via fork/exec and subprocesses
  don’t daemonize. The operating system signals Supervisor immediately
  when a process terminates, unlike some solutions that rely on
  troublesome PID files and periodic polling to restart failed
  processes.

Extensible

  Supervisor has a simple event notification protocol that programs
  written in any language can use to monitor it, and an XML-RPC
  interface for control. It is also built with extension points that
  can be leveraged by Python developers.

Compatible

  Supervisor works on just about everything except for Windows. It is
  tested and supported on Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and FreeBSD. It is
  written entirely in Python, so installation does not require a C
  compiler.

Proven

  While Supervisor is very actively developed today, it is not new
  software. Supervisor has been around for years and is already in use
  on many servers.

Supervisor Components
---------------------

:program:`supervisord`

  The server piece of supervisor is named :program:`supervisord`.  It
  is responsible for starting child programs at its own invocation,
  responding to commands from clients, restarting crashed or exited
  subprocesseses, logging its subprocess ``stdout`` and ``stderr``
  output, and generating and handling "events" corresponding to points
  in subprocess lifetimes.

  The server process uses a configuration file.  This is typically
  located in :file:`/etc/supervisord.conf`.  This configuration file
  is a "Windows-INI" style config file.  It is important to keep this
  file secure via proper filesystem permissions because it may contain
  unencrypted usernames and passwords.

:program:`supervisorctl`

  The command-line client piece of the supervisor is named
  :program:`supervisorctl`.  It provides a shell-like interface to the
  features provided by :program:`supervisord`.  From
  :program:`supervisorctl`, a user can connect to different
  :program:`supervisord` processes, get status on the subprocesses
  controlled by, stop and start subprocesses of, and get lists of
  running processes of a :program:`supervisord`.

  The command-line client talks to the server across a UNIX domain
  socket or an internet (TCP) socket.  The server can assert that the
  user of a client should present authentication credentials before it
  allows him to perform commands.  The client process typically uses
  the same configuration file as the server but any configuration file
  with a ``[supervisorctl]`` section in it will work.

Web Server

  A (sparse) web user interface with functionality comparable to
  :program:`supervisorctl` may be accessed via a browser if you start
  :program:`supervisord` against an internet socket.  Visit the server
  URL (e.g. ``http://localhost:9001/``) to view and control process
  status through the web interface after activating the configuration
  file's ``[inet_http_server]`` section.

XML-RPC Interface

  The same HTTP server which serves the web UI serves up an XML-RPC
  interface that can be used to interrogate and control supervisor and
  the programs it runs.  See :ref:`xml_rpc`.

Platform Requirements
---------------------

Supervisor has been tested and is known to run on Linux (Ubuntu 9.10),
Mac OS X (10.4/10.5/10.6), and Solaris (10 for Intel) and FreeBSD 6.1.
It will likely work fine on most UNIX systems.

Supervisor will *not* run at all under any version of Windows.

Supervisor is known to work with Python 2.4 or later but will not work
under any version of Python 3.
