Contributing
------------

Supervisor development is discussed on the mailing list.  We'll review
contributions from the community in both
`pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_
on GitHub (preferred) and patches sent to the list.

Author Information
------------------

The following people are responsible for creating Supervisor.

Original Author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Chris McDonough <https://github.com/mcdonc>`_ is the original author of
  Supervisor.

Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributors are tracked on the `GitHub contributions page
<https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/graphs/contributors>`_.  The two lists
below are included for historical reasons.

This first list recognizes significant contributions that were made
before the repository moved to GitHub.

- Anders Quist: Anders contributed the patch that was the basis for
  Supervisor’s ability to reload parts of its configuration without
  restarting.

- Derek DeVries: Derek did the web design of Supervisor’s internal web
  interface and website logos.

- Guido van Rossum: Guido authored ``zdrun`` and ``zdctl``, the
  programs from Zope that were the original basis for Supervisor.  He
  also created Python, the programming language that Supervisor is
  written in.

- Jason Kirtland: Jason fixed Supervisor to run on Python 2.6 by
  contributing a patched version of Medusa (a Supervisor dependency)
  that we now bundle.

- Roger Hoover: Roger added support for spawning FastCGI programs. He
  has also been one of the most active mailing list users, providing
  his testing and feedback.

- Siddhant Goel: Siddhant worked on :program:`supervisorctl` as our
  Google Summer of Code student for 2008. He implemented the ``fg``
  command and also added tab completion.

This second list records contributors who signed a legal agreement.
The legal agreement was
`introduced <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/commit/7bdac36e67a91b513a2e53a6098751509a7a9e34>`_
in January 2014 but later
`withdrawn <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/commit/79090d521c512634bed03a65147f16cd41456051>`_
in March 2014.  This list is being preserved in case it is useful
later (e.g. if at some point there was a desire to donate the project
to a foundation that required such agreements).
